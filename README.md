PowerShell script to search for an Event ID

This script will lookup a Event ID provided by the user and export the results to an csv file.

Script will ask the user where to search for the event .i.e Applications, Systems, security (Admin Access) or Not sure - This option will search all Logs. Therefore, will take the most amount of time and may result in unauthorised access errors.

The script will also ask for the Event ID, computer name and location (path and filename) of the CSV file. Once these parameters are provided script search logs and export the result to a CSV file.
